# string
String in C programming is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character ‘\0’. Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a unique character ‘\0’.
Declaration of Strings
Declaring a string is as simple as declaring a one-dimensional array. Below is the basic syntax for declaring a string.

char str_name[size];
In the above syntax str_name is any name given to the string variable and size is used to define the length of the string, i.e the number of characters strings will store. 
Note: There is an extra terminating character which is the Null character (‘\0’) used to indicate the termination of a string that differs strings from normal character arrays. When a Sequence of characters enclosed in the double quotation marks is encountered by the compiler, a null character ‘\0’ is appended at the end of the string by default.
